prediction_paths_with_memfade
------------------------------

This is an extention of prediction_paths script with memory fade function.

We performed a survey to see how people inference location movement data. 
We apply a forgetting factor based on our survey.
This makes the program forget (loss of weak probabilities and strenghtening the strong probablities) like human brain.
